# Command line basics

This folder contains short lessons and exercises to learn Unix, Bash, Git, and environment management.

Files:

- `01_unix_and_bash_basics.md` — basic shell commands, text processing, exercises.
- `02_git.md` — Git fundamentals, branching, merging, SSH and workflows.
- `03_good_practices.md` — script best-practices, permissions, find, robustness.
- `04_conda.md` — creating and sharing Conda environments.
- `05_containers_and_vscode.md` — Docker/Apptainer usage and VSCode + AI assistant tips (new).
- `mon_script.sh` — example script (now hardened).
- `task.txt` — short training tasks.

If you want, I can open a PR with these changes or apply further edits (more exercises, `awk` examples, or tests).
